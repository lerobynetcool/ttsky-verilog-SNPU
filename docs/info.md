## How it works

This is a random number generator... possibly. I'm not sure.

In a latch you are not supposed to set both S and R to 0. If you try to solve what the output Q and Â¬Q should be, you'll see why.

## How to test

When ui_in[0]=0, you'll get all output pins going crazy (ie both uo_out[*] = NOIIISSEE as well as uio_out[*] = NOIIIISSSEEE).

When ui_in[0]=1, you'll freeze all output pins to whatever values they had. That way you get a change to sample a value.

Well at least that's what I hope, I can't test this in software.
I bet this could be biased toward 0 or 1, or maybe show correlation between bits... or worse, it could be not random at all !

## External hardware

No external hardware required !
